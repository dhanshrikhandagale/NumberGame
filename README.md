First we are going to generate a random number using Math. random()
Then we are going to run a loop K times and each time ask the user to enter an answer.
If the user entered right then break and print "Congratulations! You guessed it right."
else print "Sorry, you've run out of attempts"
after that they are suggest the correct number and your first round code.
